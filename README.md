Real-Time Indian Sign Language Recognition:-
This project aims to build a real-time Indian Sign Language (ISL) recognition system that can interpret and translate sign language gestures into text or speech. By using computer vision and machine learning techniques, the system captures hand movements and translates them to a readable format, enabling communication for individuals who use Indian Sign Language.

Features:
Real-time gesture recognition and translation into text.

Integration of a deep learning model for accurate gesture interpretation.

Ability to recognize multiple signs in the Indian Sign Language dictionary.

User-friendly interface for seamless interaction.

Technologies Used:
Python: For core development and machine learning.

OpenCV: For real-time video processing.

TensorFlow/Keras: For building and training the gesture recognition model.

MediaPipe: For hand tracking and detection.

Flask/Django (optional): For developing a web interface (if applicable).

How It Works:
The system uses a webcam or camera input to capture real-time hand gestures.

Using hand tracking models, the system detects and identifies specific signs.

The recognized signs are then translated into text or speech.

A dictionary of predefined signs is used to match gestures with corresponding meanings.

Use Cases:
Assisting individuals with hearing and speech disabilities in communicating.

Educating people about Indian Sign Language.

Helping researchers and developers advance accessibility solutions.
